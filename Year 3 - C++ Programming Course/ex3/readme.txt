This is a program which calculates the diffraction pattern of a general 1D complex aperture using FFT techniques. It is realized using three classes: 

1) complex_array1.hh - A slightly modified version of the original header file from the cavlib library. The only change has been to change the "fft" function to "inline" because the original caused multiple definitions of the function.

2) aperture.hh, aperture.cc - These give the definition and implementation, respectively, of a class whose objects represent apertures. Key features of an aperture are its complex transmittance A(x), size, wavelength etc. 

3) screen.hh, screen.cc - These give the definition and implementation, respectively, of a class whose objects represent screens. A key feature of the screen is the pattern created on it by an aperture. The pattern on the screen can be generated by specifying the aperture, which produces it.

More information about the specifics of the classes can be found in the comments in the respective source files. 

A Makefile is included to ease the compilation of the files. To compile all tasks just use "make all".

Core Task 1:
A function representing the complex transmittance of the aperture is defined and is used to create an aperture object. The aperture object is then used to create a screen object which ten produces the pattern is all its different forms. The different forms of the pattern are printed in 9 columns. The printing function was modified to print only a section of the pattern within approximately 20 maxima from the centre, so that the resulting graph can show the needed details. The plot of the intensity pattern with overlaid theoretical expectation is in the file "Intensity_vs_y_CoreTask1.png" and the plot of the amplitude is included in the file "Amplitude_vs_y_CoreTask1.png".

Core Task 2:
The same approach has been used. The only difference is that the aperture function is different. The resulting plot is given in the file "Intensity_vs_y_CoreTask2.png". The pattern is almost the same as that of a simple slit, which is expected since the amplitude is still 1 and only the phase is changing. As an aside, a plot of the pattern resulting from the simple slit (i.e. without the change in phase) was made to compare with the original. The overall form is the same and only the magnitude of the intensity (in arbitrary units) differs between the two.

Supplementary Task 1:
In order to use more directly the codes from the core tasks I have divided the supplementary task into part a) and part b).

a) The additional phase factor was added to the aperture function definition of Core Task 1 and the resulting plot is in the file "Intensity_vs_y_SupplTask1a.png".
b) The additional phase factor was added to the phase function definition of Core Task 2 and the resulting plot is in the file "Intensity_vs_y_SupplTask1b.png".

The intensity patterns look sensible having forms which are typical for a near field diffraction pattern. The "far field" effects are still visible from the oscillations on the sides of the main diffraction patterns.
